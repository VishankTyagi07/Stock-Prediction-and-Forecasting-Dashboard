## Project Overview
This is a comprehensive machine learning model which stimulates real world stock market predictive analysis which allows the model to forcast future movements of the market.
This Project demonstrates Proficiency in **data collection**,**data visualization**,**Data analytics**,**Model creation**,**Dashboard designing**,**Predictive analysis**,**Forecasting Trends**- which are the key skills required by a Data Analyst and a Data Scientist.

### Investor Problem
The New as well as Old investors face difficulty to invest in a Company because They:
- Cannot understand the trends.
- Cannot analyze historical Data.
- Cannot visualize growth.
- cannot compare markets and their predictied trends in one place.

This causes:
- Loss of hard earned money.
- Poor financial growth.
- Loss of precious time.

**Challenges:** New investors cannot decide the time to invest in the markets which causes them to loose money and time.

**Solution:** A Predictive analysis model which can use use previous data od any market in the world and forecast future trends and values making it easier for the investors to invest in the market and earn porfit.

## Key Features

### **Stock market data collection and visualization**
- This Model uses all the markets data which can be used by user to visualize and analyze.
- This Model uses Streamlit Dashboard to show the visualization and give the result to the analysis.

### **Ensemble Approach**
This Approach is used in this model for using multiple models which helps the model to predict and forcast values more accurately.

Models used in this Project are:

- Temporal Convolution Network Model (TCN)
- Bi-Direactional Long Short Term Memory Model (BiLSTM)
- Gradient Boost Model (GBoost)

### **Statistical Analysis**
This Model use Multiple type of Statistical Analysis used for easy data understanding by the model.Some Statistical Analysis are:

- Data Scaling Using Robust Scaler
- Data Regression
- Data Normalization
- Data inversion

### **Predictive Analysis**
- This Model uses 80:20 Split for Data Training and Testing.
- This Model uses different Statistical methods.
- This Model uses different Models.
